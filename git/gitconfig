# 1. # and ; characters begin comments to the end of line, blank lines are ignored
# 2. All the other lines (and the remainder of the line after the section header) are recognized as setting variables, 
#       in the form:
# 		name		= value
#	(or just name, which is a short-hand to say that the variable is the boolean "true")
# 3. Variable names are case-insensitive, allow only alphanumeric characters and -, 
#       and must start with an alphabetic character
# 4. A line that defines a value can be continued to the next line by ending it with a \; 
#       the backquote and the end-of-line are stripped
# 5. Leading whitespaces after 'name =', the remainder of the line after the first comment character # or ;, 
#       and trailing whitespaces of the line are discarded unless they are enclosed in double quotes
# 6. Internal whitespaces within the value are retained verbatim
# 7. Inside double quotes, double quote (") and backslash (\) characters must be escaped
# 8. The following escape sequences are recognized:
#               \n	for newline character (NL)
#       	\t	for horizontal tabulation (HT, TAB)
#		\b	for backspace (BS)
# 9. Other char escape sequences (including octal escape sequences) are invalid

# Boolean true literals are "yes", "on", "true", and "1". 
#       Also, a variable defined without = <value> is taken as true
# Boolean false literals are "no", "off", "false", "0" and the empty string ("").

# The value for many variables that specify various sizes can be suffixed with k, M, â€¦, 
#       to mean "scale the number by 1024", "by 1024x1024", etc.

# Available colors: "normal", "black", "red", "green", "yellow", "blue", "magenta", "cyan", "white"
# The first color given is the foreground; the second is the background
# Colors may also be given as numbers between 0 and 255; 
#       these use ANSI 256-color mode (but note that not all terminals may support this)
# If your terminal supports it, you may also specify 24-bit RGB values as hex, like "#ff0ab3"

# Color attributes: "bold", "dim", "ul" (underline), "blink", 
#       "reverse" (background then foreground), "italic", "strike"
# Specific attributes may be turned off by prefixing them with "no" or "no-" 
#       (e.g., "noreverse", "no-ul", etc)

# An empty color string ("") produces no color effect at all; 
#       this can be used to avoid coloring specific elements without disabling color entirely.
